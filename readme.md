**STRANGER TWINS**

**Stranger Twins** is a memory game based on the Netflix series _"Stranger Things"_.

In the game, you must match all the upside down images before the timer runs out in order to escape the _"upside down"_ demension. The timer begins at 45 seconds and will begin counting down automatically. Click on box with the **DEMOGORGEN** to reveal the image you have to match. You can only flip two cards at a time. If the images match, they will remain revealed. If they do not match, they will flip back over and you must try to match the image again. 

For every match you will receive a point. To win the game you must match all 8 images to get 8 points. 
If you do not match all 8 images before the timer runs out you will be trapped in the _"upside down"_ demension. 

Motivation:
I like memory games and wanted to base the game on the Netflix series.
